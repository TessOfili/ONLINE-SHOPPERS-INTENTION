# ONLINE-SHOPPERS-INTENTION
The data used in this analysis is an Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention data set provided from a top ecommerce site. The data set was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.

The primary purpose of the data set is to predict the purchasing intentions of a visitor to this particular storeâ€™s website. This dataset has very few missing values and all features of the dataset are relevant to the purchasing intention based on inference.
